Flutter project for interview purposes .

## Done

✅ - Github workflow (Tests)\
✅ - Integration tests (Patrol) + Cubit tests\
✅ - Internationalizing l10n (events endpoint works fine, quick-search endpoint throw 500)\
✅ - Go router simple routing \
✅ - Rest API integration (Dio, Retrofit)\
✅ - Global colors and fonts


## Additional
- Due to the size of the project, I opted for a simple architecture following the data, domain, and presentation layers. This approach keeps the codebase clean and maintainable without adding unnecessary complexity.
- The color and font library is not defined in figma.  So I defined them in the application in a simple way but I recommend to define them in figma according to material design and map them in flutter 

## Issues

- quick-search Endpoint throw 500 for en language so internationalization not working for this endpoint, events endpoint works fine
- Since the provided documentation does not say anything about which games to show on the main screen and in the search screen from each event, I simplified the design so that it can be implemented on the available event data

- The documentation does not indicate that pagination is available. So it has not been implemented
- 
## TODO
- More tests. I focused on demonstrating skills not testing the whole app
- After clarefication doubts with endpoint data, we can adjust the look of card events
